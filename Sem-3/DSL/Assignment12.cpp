/*
Write  program  to  implement  a  priority  queue  in  C++  using  an  inorder  list  to  store  the 
items in  the queue.  Create a class  that  includes the data items (which  should  be 
template)  and  the  priority  (which  should  be  int).  The  inorder  list  should  contain  these 
objects, with operator <= overloaded so that the items with highest priority appear at the 
start of the list (which will make it relatively easy to retrieve the highest item.)
